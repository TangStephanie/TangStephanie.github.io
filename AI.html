<h2>AI music</h2>
<p><a href="https://soundraw.io">AI music: soundraw</a></p>
AI music refers to songs that were created, wholly or in part, with the aid of machine learning. The term is less commonly used to describe audio engineering practices, like the use of AI to automate audio processing.
<h2>AI coding</h2>
<h3>1. OpenAI Codex</h3>
<p>OpenAI Codex is the model based on GPT-3 that powers GitHub Copilot - a tool from GitHub to generate code within mainstream development environments including VS Code, Neovim, JetBrains, and even in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces. It claims to write code in at least a dozen languages, including JavaScript, Go, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Swift and TypeScript, and even BASH. The model is trained on billions of lines of code available in the public domain, such as GitHub repositories.</p>
<h3>2. Tabnine</h3>
<p>While Tabnine is not an end-to-end code generator, it puts the auto-completion feature of the integrated development environment (IDE) on steroids. Developed in Rust by Jacob Jackson when he was a student at the University of Waterloo, Tabnine has evolved into a fully-fledged, AI-based code completion tool.</p>
<h3>3. CodeT5</h3>
<p>CodeT5 is an open source programming language model built by researchers at SalesForce. It is based on Google’s T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) framework. In order to train CodeT5, the team sourced over 8.35 million instances of code, including user comments, from publicly accessible GitHub repositories. A majority of these datasets were derived from the CodeSearchNet dataset, which includes Ruby, JavaScript, Go, Python, PHP, C, and C#, in addition to two C and C# datasets from BigQuery.</p>

<h2>Self-driving</h2>
<p>also known as an autonomous car, driver-less car, or robotic car (robo-car)</p>
<p>Autonomy in vehicles is oftencategorized in six levels, accordingto a system developed by SAEInternational (SAE J3016, revisedperiodically).</p>
<p>Level 0 - no automation</p>
Level 1 - hands on/shared control
Level 2 - hands off;
Level 3 - eyes off
Level 4 - mind off
Level 5 - steering wheel optional
